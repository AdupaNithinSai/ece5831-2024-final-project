# ECE5831 - Final Project  

This repository contains an interactive visualization tool for Convolutional Neural Networks, built as a project for one of our courses, **ECE5831 Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks**. The tool is designed for educators, students, and researchers. This project provides real-time, layer-by-layer visualization of CNN operations, helping users intuitively learn about complex concepts.  

The **Interactive CNN Visualization Tool** allows users to:  
- **Draw Images**: Provide customized images for processing by the CNN.  
- **Visualize in Real Time**: Observe feature maps and activation patterns through convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.  
- **Understand CNN Operations**: Gain insights into edge detection, feature extraction, and classification processes.  

The project uses **Streamlit** for the interactive interface, **TensorFlow** for the CNN architecture, and **OpenCV** for image preprocessing.  

**NOTE:** The Jupyter notebook only runs the demo. If you wish to check out the UI, please run the project with Streamlit.  

## Getting Started  
1. **Install the dependencies:**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
2. **Run the Application:**  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  
3. **Input an Image:**  
   You can either draw an image using the interactive canvas or upload a custom image.  

Explore visualizations of the CNN layers!  

## Resources

- **Dataset:** We havenâ€™t used any specific dataset since our project focuses on visualization rather than training a CNN for one specific dataset.
